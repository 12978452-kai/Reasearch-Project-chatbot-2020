# UTS FEIT Chatbot
Supervisor: [Wei Liu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/wei.liu)

## Description
UTS FEIT Chatbot is a chatbot directed for prospective high school students in search of universities to get into. The chatbot is able to answer user queries regarding courses at UTS including details of the course such as duration, credit points, as well as answering queries regarding the structure of courses and subjects at UTS. In this project, we aim to create a chat bot with course query for both UTS university students and postgraduate students, as well as a UI interface and a database to store chatbotâ€™ conversions records. 

## Functionality

### Greeting/Introduction
As a bare minimum for chatbots, the bot is able to say hello and good morning, and respond to thank you. In addition, the bot would tell users what it is able to do when asked.

### Describe an item by code or name
The bot is able to respond with a short description of a course/major/subject when presented with the code or name of the item. The description is followed by an URL to the UTS Handbook. 

### Staying in contet with slots
The chatbot stores the current entity (course) in a slot and can further continue conversations regarding said entity.

### Questions regarding details of the item
The chatbot can retrieve details of the course from the dataset, i.e. credit points, duration, as well as boolean details (is it a combined degree/honours degree or not)

### Structure information
The chatbot is able to retrieve substructures of a structure when asked (what subjects are in a subject, what majors are in a choice block, etc.)

## Tracker Stores
All conversations are stored within a tracker store. In this chatbot, the conversations are stored in rasa.db. The official compatible databases is: PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite. For setting up the database with SQL, user need to add the require configuration in endpoints.yml.
The configuration is the following:
tracker_store:
```
    type: SQL
    dialect: "sqlite"  # the dialect used to interact with the db
    url: ""  # (optional) host of the sql db, e.g. "localhost"
    db: "rasa"  # path to your db
    username:  # username used for authentication
    password:  # password used for authentication
    query: # optional dictionary to be added as a query string to the connection URL
    driver: my-driver
```
After adding the configuration, the conversation data can be saved the the database.
